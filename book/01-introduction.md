# Introduction

Welcome to *An Architect's Guide to Databricks*! This book is for data engineers, architects, and anyone who wants to design, build, and run Databricks environments that are secure, reliable, and efficient — without pulling their hair out along the way.  

The Foreword already gives you a bit of background on why this book exists, so here’s a quick guide on how to get the most out of it:

- **Practical advice**: Each chapter is packed with tips, patterns, and examples based on real projects — from small startups to large enterprises.  
- **Step-by-step coverage**: We’ll take you from the basics (understanding Databricks architecture and key concepts) through planning, data engineering, access controls, and real-world deployments.  
- **Best practices**: Learn how to plan your environment, set up workspaces, manage storage, implement CI/CD, work with Delta tables, orchestrate jobs, and control access.  
- **Flexible reading**: You don’t have to read it cover-to-cover. Jump to the parts you need, or follow the sequence for a full picture of how to run a successful Databricks environment.  

By the end of this book, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to plan, deploy, and optimize Databricks workloads — and hopefully save yourself a lot of headaches in the process.
