# Foreword

Welcome to *An Architect's Guide to Databricks*.  

This book is built on **real examples**, written by a Databricks Resident Solution Architect (RSA) who has implemented Databricks across many clients, both large and small. It is designed for data engineers, architects, and anyone responsible for building reliable, secure, and high-performing data platforms on Databricks.

Its goal is to provide practical guidance aligned with the Databricks Well-Architected Framework, helping you make informed decisions as you design and operate your data lakehouse. Throughout this book, you'll find actionable tips, patterns, and examples that can be applied in real-world projects. You don’t need to memorize everything — the intent is to give you a clear understanding of the principles so you can apply them effectively.

Whether you are just starting with Databricks or looking to optimize an existing environment, this guide aims to save you time, reduce mistakes, and help you build systems that deliver real business value.
